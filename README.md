Predator chasing after prey (2d or 3d).

The predator is always accelerating in a straight line towards the prey, whereas the prey is able to turn away from the predator. The prey is more agile (faster accelaration) but the predator has a higher top speed. The question is how do acceleration and speed imbalances between the two affect the probability of death. 
We can consider different: 'reaction radius' values
