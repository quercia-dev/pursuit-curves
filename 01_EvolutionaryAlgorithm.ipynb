    "### Pursuit Evasion Games\n",
    "\n",
    "Pursuit Evasion Games are a subclass of non-cooperative games. The simplest case includes a pursuer and an evader, which in our case are referred to as the predator and prey respectively. The pursuer's objective is to catch the evader, while the evader must avoid capture. This is a zero-sum game of competing interests. The characteristics of the two players are different. In our experiment we give the predator an advantage in top speed, whereas the prey has an agility advantage, encoded as having a higher acceleration. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Structure\n",
    "The game has been defined in the `00_Deterministic` notebook, where we also added functionality to simulate, plot, and perform signal processing through discrete cosine transform. The purpose of `00_Deterministic` is to explore the different behaviors that can emerge from this Differential Game. In the next section we will take this game, tweak its architecture and propose an evolutionary algorithm to find the predator and prey's best parameters."

    "## Fitness Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The next important part of an evolutionary algorithm is the fitness function, to quantify how well the current genetic combination of prey and predator are performing. This metric will be important in deciding the \"survival of the fittest\", the best genomes that will go on to reproduce and create the new offspring of agents. Again, we will need a unique way of assessing the fitness of predators and prey, as they have distinct, and competing, interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predator** \\\n",
    "The predator's goal is to catch the prey, so we can start by giving the predator `0` reward if the prey is not caught within the allotted time or distance. From this, a natural fitness measure could be the `capture_time`, where the lower this value is, the better the predator's performance. In addition, we could also look at the predator's `pursuit_efficiency`, which is defined by dividing the straight line distance between the predator's initial position and the eventual capture, and the distance that the predator actual travelled within the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prey** \\  \n",
    "For the prey there are a few metrics that could help us understand how well it is evading its pursuer. For one, `survival_time` is crucial, because the longer the prey evades capture, the more effectively it is out of reach of the predator's hungry fangs. We could also look at `total_distance` travelled, which would tell us how far the prey got before it was taken down. Another metric could be a calculation of the `average_distance` the prey was able to keep between itself and the predator. One can imagine that a few strategies may arise for the prey, namely, getting as far away from the predator, and maintaining that distance, but also being just out of reach for the predator, making use of its agility. Because of this, we will be implementing a more nuanced fitness function, rewarding both distance and time away from the predator."

    "## Variation Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to define the evolutionary operators, that are needed to generate new candidate solutions. The operators are divided into different types based on their arity, the number of inputs that go into the variation. The selection operator does not have an arity as it acts as more of a filtering operator, selecting a subset out of all individuals that will be able to reproduce.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Selection\n",
    "Selection is the process of picking individuals from a population to serve as parents for the next generation of offspring. The operator evaluates the fitness of each individual and probabilistically favors those with higher fitness, guiding the evolutionary process toward better solutions. Selection does not modify the individuals themselves but determines which genotypes are allowed to reproduce. It ensures that advantageous traits are more likely to be propagated, while also maintaining genetic diversity to avoid premature convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutation\n",
    "The mutation is a unary variation operator that is applied to one genotype and delivers a slightly modified mutant, which is referred to as the child or offspring. This operator acts on one genotype and returns another. It causes a small, random variation, which may or may not help improve the fitness of its offspring. These mutations help the species explore new territory in the parameter space, effectively guaranteeing that the space is connected. The element of randomness is essential to its functioning, as well as differentiating it from other unary heuristic operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recombination\n",
    "Recombination is a binary variation operator with the role of merging information from two parent genotypes into their offspring genotypes. The choice of what information is merged is stochastic. There is a chance that through recombination, the offspring performs as well, or even worse than the parents. Yet the hope is that in combining parents genotypes, the emerging combination of genomes in the offspring represents an improvement in the fitness of the individual.\n"
